Hi, I am Faris, and i am passionate about Free and Open source software, and Cloud computing
I am the technical Director at [the Aosus Community]({{< ref "/projects" >}}), and I created [ARhackintosh]({{< ref "/projects" >}}), the Arabic community for Hackintosh.

I spend my time experimenting with FOSS and cloud computing as i like to learn by doing.
