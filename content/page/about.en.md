Hi, I am Faris, passionate about Free and Open source software, and Cloud computing.
I work on [the Aosus Community]({{< ref "/projects" >}}), the biggest Arabic community for FOSS, and I created [ARhackintosh]({{< ref "/projects" >}}), a place where you found anything hackintosh related in Arabic.

I spend my time experimenting with FOSS and cloud computing as I like to learn by doing.
